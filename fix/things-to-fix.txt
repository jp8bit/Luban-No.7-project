1 - found a bug, when an tool tip is too big and too the right side, it gets more height and less width. However, when you hover on another tooltip of the same name, it will bug and go way more up than above it. Will fix later (it can be fixed by putting some filler text, but i will investigate it later. Also, it only happens to the right side of the screen, not the left. Strange)

2 - Make a general css for things that all of them have, such as header, footer and whatnot
