        <h1>THE DEFINITIVE</h1>
        <p>LUBAN NO.7 ULTIMATE GUIDE</p>
        <p>(don't play him he sucks lol)</p>

      <div class="introduction-section">
        <h2>What is The Definitive Luban No.7 Ultimate Guide?</h2>
        <p>Luban No.7 is a character from the Mobile MOBA game, Honor of Kings. He is an Marksmen designed to go to the bottom lane, with high damage and continuous attacks from afar.</p>
        <p>
          Also, he is largely considered to be the one of the worst characters in the game, due to his reliance on his team and lack of mobility. In short, if you want to climb on rank, don't play him.
        </p>

        <p>Essentially, this guide is to make you not completely suck when playing him, with detailed strategies, guides, builds and ALL Match-ups</p>
        <h2>
          If he sucks, why are you making this guide then??????
        </h2>
        <p>Because I can lol. For real though, it feels very rewarding to play with this fella despite all his downsides, especially if you win. He teaches you a lot about careful positioning, which is super important for an Marksman, so I made this guide for people to use him to his full potential.</p>
        
        <p>Also, he's just a little guy, how can you not like him?</p>
        <h2>Soooooo do you have any way experience with him if you're making this guide?</h2>
        <p>Quite, here is my Winrate with him:</p>
        <section class="winrates-container-luban">

        </section>
        <p>Also, here are my winrates with other marksmen, to erase any doubts: (also sorry for using their titles rather than their names, i forgo to change it <img src="images/cat-explosion.gif" alt="Cat exploding meme" class="cat-boom">)
        </p>
