ACCESS IT HERE!!! --> <a href="https://jp8bit.github.io/Luban-No.7-project/index.html">Xeniel's Codex</a>

<p>Admiteddly, after doing the todo list and weather app (which is finished, i just haven't been able to release it yet due to api key leaks and stuff), i got a tad bit burnt out. They both just felt so corporate and like, soulless. I tried adding some character and charm with the visuals but i just wasnt interested in what I was doing.</p>

<p>So, in order to actually talk about something I like, i decided to make a super, way too over-explained guide on a character called Luban No.7. Idk i just love the lil guy and wanted to talk about him.</p>

<p>I'm thankful I did this though as it was actually super fun to write about. Made me feel like the start with the Good Kid project with how much stuff I put in it.</p>

<p>As For the actual project, it is BY FAR the biggest one I did, and the most ambitious. Essentially, I pretty much made a complete guide site with all the sections players need to know how to play the hero.</p>

<p>I do plan to continue this one and add more heroes to it, but not now as i need to learn more stuff and adding another hero is pretty much just me changing and adding some values and stuff as I already did all the hard work. There are definitely some rough parts that i plan to improve, mainly the header and footer, but i liked what i did</p>
