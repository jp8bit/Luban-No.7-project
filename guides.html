      <p>To start, we need to first understand his skillset. While they may seem simple, they have interesting quirks about them and I'll provide tips on how you should use them.</p>

      <h2>PASSIVE - SUPPRESIVE FIRE</h2>

      <p>Luban No.7's next basic attack after four basics attacks will be enhanced into a strafe, gaining a piercing effect and dealing continuous damage, max of 3 ticks of continuous damage. It deals porcentage damage on <span style="color: #80f280;">Max Health</span> against heroes.</p>
      <h2>FIRST SKILL - BLOWFISH GRENADE</h2>
      <div class="video-skills">

      <p>Luban No.7 tosses a blowfish grenade on the designated area, dealing damage and applying a <span style="color: rgb(101, 159, 240);">slow</span> effect. Additionally, grants vision on the enemies who are hit for a short period of time.</p>
      <h2>SECOND SKILL - SHARK CANNON</h2>
      <div class="video-skills"> 
      <video autoplay muted loop playsinline loading="lazy">

      </div>
      <p>Luban No.7 launches a rocket, dealing damage to the enemy hit. This skill has <span style="font-weight: bolder;">global</span> range and will deal splash damage after impact. If there is a enemy directly in front of Luban No.7, the rocket will knock them back.</p>
      <h2>ULTIMATE - AIR SUPPORT</h2>
      <div class="video-skills"> 
      <video autoplay muted loop playsinline loading="lazy">

      </div>
      <p>Luban No.7 summons a Blowfish Airship to initiate air support. It will drop bombs at <span style="font-weight: bolder;">random</span> enemies within range at every second. The bombs will deal damage and apply a <span style="color: #659ff0;">slow</span> effect. It continuosly grants vision within the airship's attack range</p>

        <h1>Tips and Combos</h1>
        <p>
          To start off, let's talk about his passive:
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll probably already know this but to maximize the damage, you need to stand still. This is why you need super careful positioning as the enhanced autos are where your damage is at, and you will die easily if you're badly positioned. I'm not gonna tell you to 'duhhh just be in a good position' as that is obvious, but generally, <strong>don't</strong> attack if the place that you're in could cause you to die
        </p>
        <p>
           The range on it is a bit misleading. It reaches <strong>slightly</strong> further than the preview shows. <!--I'll add images to demonstrate later-->
        </p>
        <p>
          What this means is that essentially, in laning phase, you'll end up most likely be out-ranging anyone that isn't Garo. And this is very important to know because Luban No.7's laning is very oppresive if the enemy doesnt get help from supports, so you <strong>should </strong>(if you can) pressure the enemy laner as much as possible with enhanced autos. Of course, there are some lanes in which you can't do this freely, but we'll talk about that in the match-ups section.
        </p>
        <p>Another thing to keep in mind is that it deals damage based on <span style="color: #80f280;">Max Health</span> of heroes. What this means is that his <strong>enhanced auto</strong> (only the enhanced auto, not all of his kit) will deal damage the more health a enemy has, making him a decent tank-buster. Is he the best tank buster? ehhh no (cough cough Marco Polo, cough cough Di Renjie) but he can work yeah <img src="images/nod-cat-nod.gif" alt="cat-nod" style="max-width: 50px; max-height: 50px; position: absolute; margin-left: 5px;"></p>
        <h1>Blowfish Grenade</h1>
        <p>This skill is the one you'll start at level one, <strong>always.</strong> If you manage to land it on the enemy ADC alon with you enhanced auto, you've already managed to take around <strong>50%</strong> of their health, which is HUGE.</p>
        <p>Additionally, an enhanced auto followed by S1 and another enhanced auto will most likely full clear a wave, meaning you'll probably reach level two first and apply more pressure.</p>
        <p>Also, the <span style="color: #659ff0;">slow</span> it has is kinda good. (25% at level one up to 50% at max), mainly because you can safely hit your S2 and your ult will ping them for one tick of damage <!-- put another video here--></p>
        <p>Not much to say, just a decent skill really.</p>
        <h1>Shark Cannon</h1>
        <p>This is hands-down his best skill BY FAR. Mainly due to the versatility it offers.</p>
        <p>First of all, <strong>DO NOT</strong> throw this willy nilly. You'll use this skill for three uses mostly.</p>
        <p>First, and the most obvious one: Getting a kill on someone who is low. It doesn't  happen much as hitting is quite difficult but if you can do it then it's really good</p>
        <p>Second: Getting <strong>Vision</strong>
        You can use it in two ways, one as soon as you rech level two to see which buff did the enemy jungler start, or two, to see if they are doing an objective. Keep in mind that the splash damage it does can steal a buff or an objective, but that is super rare.</p>
        <p>And lastly, the one you'll likely use the most, to knock-back people who are close to you. At late-game this is the most important one, if you end up wasting your S2 you're most likely dead.</p>
        <h2>Now, there are two techs you can do with this skill, both regarding the usage of flash. <!--Add videos for both--></h2>
        <p>
          The first one is Surprise knockback 3000. You'll use your S2, and immediatelly follow it up with a flash. This will catch a lot of enemies off guard, and can catch multipla enemies. Think of it as a mini Dharma ult.
        </p>
        <p>
        The second one is the reverse pull 9000. This one is one that you should never use because while it works it is very inconsisten to land. You need to close enough to an enemy to knock them back, and as you press the skill one, you need to time your flash as it land to succesfully pull the enemy. Don't do this one at rankeds lol, is kinda bad but it's funny.
        </p>
        <h1>Air Support</h1>
        <p>This skill is a bit interesting, so let's go over what you should do</p>
